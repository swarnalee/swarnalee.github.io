I am fascinated by the amazing new advancements taking place in the various fields of Civil Engineering spanning from transport \u0026amp; network systems, hydrological sciences, geosciences to geotechnical engineering, uses of efficient tools for understanding problems better and solving them.\nCurrently, I am working with Dr. Suprava Jena and with Dr. Amit Kumar Das. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked closely with Prof. Ashim Kanti Dey.\nApart from academics, I dabble often in pretty much everything but human psychology (behavioural!) and science \u0026amp; tech happen to have the largest shares. These days I am exploring ICT effects on Transportation Systems and also teaching myself to code.\nWill be more than happy to connect!
