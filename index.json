[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"My life is currently under construction (isn\u0026rsquo;t it always though?). I am a Civil Engineering undergraduate student at NIT Silchar 🎓. It was during my junior year when I realised that I truly enjoy research work. I am fascinated by the amazing new advancements taking place in the various fields of Civil Engineering spanning from transport \u0026amp; network systems, geosciences to geotechnical engineering, uses of AI/ML for understanding problems better and solving them.\nCurrently, I am working with Dr. Suprava Jena and with Dr. Amit Kumar Das. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked closely with Prof. Ashim Kanti Dey.\nApart from academics, I dabble often in human psychology (behavioural!) and space sciences. I enjoy reading (and sometimes writing) blogs, making nice Spotify playlists :) and playing the Ukulele. Also, these days I am teaching myself to code.\nWill be more than happy to connect!
